In this talk, we present a technical report on our open-source compiler, namely ONNX-MLIR, which uses MLIR to compile ONNX models into native code on different architectures e.g., x86, IBM Power, IBM Z. We will discuss the core design of ONNX-MLIR, the optimizations it deploys, and how it supports custom AI accelerators. ONNX-MLIR has been developed since 2019, shortly after MLIR was introduced. Thus, we would also like to discuss some lessons learned when building ONNX-MLIR in parallel with the growth of MLIR compiler infrastructure.",

Specifically, I will talk about the deployment of hardened libc++, and explain a series of improvements and extensions we made to Clang’s compile-time pointer lifetime analysis around lifetimebound annotations. By enabling hardened libc++ in all of our products, and adopting the annotations in our key core libraries, we have been able to reduce a significant number of safety violations, and improve the reliability and correctness of our code. I will also touch on ongoing efforts and future work in this area.",

Currently, this work must be done by LLDB’s full expression evaluator, a very powerful but somewhat slow and heavyweight mechanism. However, these expressions tend to be small and simple, so most of them could be evaluated much faster. The approach of a fast limited expression evaluator was leveraged in lldb-eval for a limited C++ subset proving that the approach is viable. In this talk we introduce the Data Inspection Language (DIL) – a new LLVM mainline effort based partly on lldb-eval that aims to expand its capabilities, make it more robust and language-agnostic. The goal of DIL is to eventually replace the existing frame variable mechanism in LLDB, permitting it to be used for simple expression evaluation. This new implementation will greatly increase the capabilities of ‘frame variable’, allowing it to quickly and directly evaluate simple expressions, in turn allowing to bypass the full expression evaluator in many common cases.",

This talk explains what the Fujitsu Compiler Test Suite and the Flang CI are and how the LLVM community can leverage them.",

      "abstract": "Our investigation revealed that the optimization of loops involving complex number division in Flang performs worse than Gfortran. This performance difference was confirmed in SPEC CPU 2017’s cam4 benchmark. The reason for this is that the current Flang can only lower complex number division to scalar runtime functions (such as “__divdc3”), preventing vectorization and inlining. Therefore, we considered using the MLIR’s complex dialect to compute complex number division. This talk will explain the calculation methods for complex number division and our work in MLIR.",

In this talk, we present our newly developed double-fetch checker for the Clang Static Analyzer, which builds on research prototypes (e.g., DFTracker) and uses memory-access provenance, alias relationships, and control-flow analysis to detect repeated reads from user memory. We’ll share how we reduce false positives through tailored heuristics, explore extensions for RTOS-specific environments, and outline future directions aimed at improving kernel and embedded security.",
