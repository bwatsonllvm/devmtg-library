In comparison to general correctness and optimization, we're lacking tools to test correct code generation of security hardening features. This presentation shows the results of an experiment to build a prototype binary static analyzer for 2 security hardening features (pac-ret, stack clash) using BOLT. The results are promising and I propose to integrate this into the upstream BOLT project to enable us to implement higher-quality security mitigations in LLVM and other compilers.",

We're interested here in the compile-time performance (the efficiency of the compiler implementation) instead of the generated code. We will go through implementation details of MLIR and quantify the cost of common operations (traversing or mutating the IR). We will then expose some anti-patterns that we unfortunately commonly see in MLIR-based compilers. Finally we will go through a few elements that are impacting the performance of the IR: for example the threading model of MLIR, how to use resources for zero-overhead management of large constants, taking advantage of the Properties custom storage on operations, or the aspect related to Type/Attribute intrinsic to the storage in the MLIRContext.",

However there are many layers of indirection underlying their implementation, which are quite difficult to grasp with.

And finally, we have a tool to measure an iOS app's page faults on a device to showcase our results.

While existing work has used SMT solving to verify LLVM’s peephole optimizations or in symbolic execution engines like KLEE, we flip the script and use LLVM optimizations to improve constraint solving. Our strategy is to translate SMT constraints into LLVM IR, apply the optimizer, and then translate back, alleviating manual developer effort in understanding both solver and LLVM internals. We find that SLOT speeds up average solving times by up to 2x for floating-point and bitvector constraints, and increases the number of constraints solved at fixed timeouts by up to 80%.",

Instead, the structure code generation approach evolved hand-in-hand with the progressive lowering philosophy of MLIR and permeates most of its dialects involved in code generation. This talk attempts to demystify the structured code generation in MLIR by introducing the relevant concepts bottom-up from individual arithmetic operations on scalars, to single instruction multiple data (SIMD) operations on vectors, to manipulations on multi-dimensional tensors. Using small examples and illustrations, it demonstrates that this approach boils down to a handful of concepts largely present in modern hardware though with a slightly different terminology. It does not require deep understanding of MLIR or any specific dialect.",

Current approaches for measuring the extent of coverage of local variables are based on crude assumptions (for example, assuming variables could cover their whole parent scope) and are not comparable from one compilation to another. In this talk, we propose some new metrics, computable by our tools, which could serve as motivation for language implementations to improve debugging quality.",

By treating 'if's and loops as first-class citizens the implementation of transformation passes is simplified and further analysis of loops made easier and incremental. However, depending on the input language, lowering to structured control flow is non-trivial compared to CFGs. This talk therefore presents the recent upstream implementation of lifting control flow graphs to structured control flow. After elaborating what structured control flow is and showing use-cases for lifting from a CFG, the talk further goes into how the upstream implementation works, how it can be used with custom dialects, and any input constraints and guarantees given by the algorithm.",

      "abstract": "The Transform dialect exposes transformations of MLIR as ops in MLIR. These fine-grained operations can be sequenced to express more involved transformations. When such a sequence expresses a coherent lowering step we refer to it as a schedule. By recent additions to the Transform dialect, we can name these schedules and call them from other sequences. Leveraging this feature, we show how Transform ops compose into reusable schedules and how schedules compose into larger schedules. We show that entire MLIR-lowering pipelines can be declaratively specified in MLIR with large parts being shared among pipelines.",

      "abstract": "In certain programs not all the expressions need to use all available bits of precision by the target machine. Also, there are many 32 bit programs that now run in 64-bit targets. Usually, in integer arithmetic and in floating-point arithmetic not all the expressions of a program need all the width of the register, but due to the switch from 32 to 64-bit architectures the registers are usually 64 bits. The compiler has to perform sign extensions in the narrow operations to preserve meaning. However, we can eliminate some sign extensions because not all of them are needed. The key is to know what each operator accepts and produces in their upper bits. Doing it in the LLVM Frontend only adds support for this optimization for one language. In this approach, we performed this optimization inside the LLVM IR. One problem is that if we find an optimal solution for one Node, it might not result in an optimal overall solution. If we had an abstract syntax tree, this problem is completely solvable using Dynamic Programming. This not the case with SSA-form in LLVM IR, because we have a DAG with many users. In this work we explore how to apply the dynamic programming optimization from syntax trees where each node occurs once to LLVM IR where each instruction may be involved in multiple chains.",

However, subtle errors in handling reference parameters can lead to dangling references and use-after-free issues. A key requirement is ensuring the lifetime of reference parameters extends throughout the entire coroutine execution, not merely the first suspension point. We explore common lifetime pitfalls in coroutines, particularly when integrated with constructs like `std::function`. We introduce the [[clang::coro_lifetimebound]] attribute, extending Clang's lifetime bound analysis to identify these issues at compile time, significantly improving coroutine code safety.",

Using too large of a floating-point type can limit performance, whereas using too small a floating-point type reduces accuracy. This has been especially critical in machine learning applications, where manually tuning floating point type is required to ensure large language models do not overwhelm the available memory bandwidth. Typically, a programmer makes a choice of the floating operation in their application, and any changes require require extensive rewrites of the code. This both limits the ability of changing representation for any large codebases, and is especially restrictive if one wants to search over the space of available floating point sizes. Integrated as part of the Enzyme framework, we introduce a pass to automatically change the floating point precision in existing applications. This can be applied at both a whole-application level, as well as planned support for individual operations. A motivation for building this within an AD framework is to leverage the floating-point error results that can be generated by AD to automatically select which floating point computations can be changed without substantially changing the accuracy of the end program.",

We present an approach that combines together the advantages of both AOT and JIT compilation, where the overhead of JIT compilation is avoided by utilizing natively executed methods and improving the warm-up performance. The goal of our current follow-up work is to more automatically determine which code candidates are suitable for native execution.

      "abstract": "Addressing the diverse needs of points-to analysis in various use-cases requires a flexible approach. In this talk you can learn about a new unifying framework, PoTATo, designed to allow users to select an algorithm that suits their specific needs. PoTATo employs a novel approach, representing memory effects as a simplified dialect generated from a source IR. This simplified representation abstracts away unnecessary IR details, unifying the analysis process. Furthermore, leveraging general MLIR tooling, the representation can be optimised, significantly reducing the points-to analysis problem. This talk showcases how PoTATo has successfully transformed the complexity of points-to analysis into a streamlined dialect transition.",

At the heart of VAST lies a versatile stack of intermediate representations (tower of IRs), empowering users to select the most suitable representations for program analysis or subsequent abstraction. Emphasizing its core infrastructure built around the IR stack, we will demonstrate its practical applications in diverse compilation scenarios, including static analysis, language transpilation, and decompilation.",

We quantify a number of factors related to the optimization pipeline including which optimizations are run, how long they take, and perform an analysis of the code at the end on a massive corpus of multi-language IR. We anticipate our results to be a starting point for deeper specific investigations on issues like the optimality of the current pass pipelines and help to better understand where compile time is spent. Initial results are presented here but the talk will focus on knowledge filtered out of this data and more we will gather in the meantime.",
