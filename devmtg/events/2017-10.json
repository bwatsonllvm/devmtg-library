      "abstract": "Tobias Edler von Koch, Sergei Larin, Shankar Easwaran and Hemant Kulkarni Custom linker scripts are used pervasively in the embedded world to control the memory layout of the linker's output file. In particular, they allow the user to describe how sections in the input files should be mapped into the output file. This mapping is expressed using wildcard patterns that are matched to section names and input paths. The linker scripts for complex embedded software projects often contain thousands of such path-based rules to enable features like tightly-coupled memories (TCM), compression, and RAM/ROM assignment. Unfortunately, the current implementation of (Thin)LTO in LLVM is incompatible with linker scripts for two reasons: Firstly, regular LTO operates by merging all input modules into one and compiling the merged module into a single output file. This prevents the path-based rules from matching, since all input sections now appear to originate from the same file. Secondly, the lack of awareness about linker script directives may lead to (Thin)LTO applying optimizations that violate user assumptions, for instance by merging constants across output section boundaries. In this talk, we present a mechanism to enable (Thin)LTO with linker scripts in LLVM and compatible linkers. It is based on the addition of a small number of attributes to GlobalObjects as well as additional APIs for the linker during symbol resolution. The key advantage of our approach is that it does not require fundamental changes to the architecture of (Thin)LTO and yet extends the benefits of link-time optimization to a vast array of embedded applications. This implementation is already in production use and our talk will show how it benefits a complex embedded application with 10,000+ linker script rules.",

If you get it right, it can enhance existing software by allowing dynamic generation of optimized parsers for data formats encountered at runtime; dynamic optimization of tight loops with respect to values known at runtime; and runtime instrumentation in support of low-overhead debugging and software monitoring. It can also enable dynamic software development methodologies, such as Read-Eval-Print Loops (REPLs), where software is implemented and composed at runtime. Getting it right is the tricky part. Luckily, partial solutions already exist in the LLVM ecosystem in the form of projects like Cling and LLDB. We are making progress on bringing the functional components of these solutions into LLVM and Clang as composable parts. This talk will summarize these efforts. However, we also need to think about how to expose these features at the language level. How can we exploit the strengths of the C++ language, especially its type safety, and ensure that their guarantees aren't undermined? This talk will serve to open a discussion as to how this feature might look.",

      "abstract": "LLVM provides a metadata-driven type-based alias analysis (TBAA), designed to represent pointer aliasing restrictions from C/C++ type-based aliasing rules, and used by many frontends, that can serve as an important optimization enabler. In the context of C/C++, the programmer bears most of the responsibility for ensuring that the program obeys these rules. As you might expect, programmers often get this wrong. In fact, many programs are compiled with -fno-strict-aliasing, the flag which disables the production of TBAA metadata. LLVM has long featured an extensive set of sanitizers: instrumentation-based tools that can detect violations of the rules restricting defined program behavior. These tools have relatively-low overhead and find an impressive number of bugs. In this talk, I'll describe the type sanitizer. This new sanitizer detects violations of type-aliasing rules allowing the programmer to pinpoint and correct problematic code. I'll cover how the type sanitizer leverages existing TBAA metadata to guide its instrumentation and how it was implemented with relative ease by taking advantage of common infrastructure within compiler-rt. Finally, I'll demonstrate some results from applying the type sanitizer to widely-used open-source software.",

Generation-based fuzzers (e.g. Csmith) can create valid C/C++ inputs and stress deep corners of a compiler, but such tools require huge effort and ingenuity to implement for every small subset of the input language. Coverage-guided fuzzing engines (e.g. AFL or libFuzzer) can find bugs with much less effort, but, when applied to compilers, they typically ‘scratch the surface’, i.e. find bugs in the shallow layers of the compiler (lexer, parser). The obvious next step is to combine the semantics-awareness of generation-based fuzzers with the power and simplicity of coverage-guided mutation. Protocol buffers are a widely used mechanism for describing and serializing structured data. Libprotobuf-mutator is a library that applies random mutations to protocol buffers. LLVM’s libFuzzer is a general purpose fuzzing engine that can use libprotobuf-mutator as an external mutator. The idea of a structure-aware fuzzer for a C++ compiler is to loosely describe a subset of C++ as a protocol buffer and implement a protobuf-to-C++ converter. Then libFuzzer and llibprotobuf-mutator will generate a diverse corpus of valid C++ programs. We will demonstrate the initial version of such ‘structure-aware’ fuzzer for Clang/LLVM, discuss the bugs it has already uncovered, propose more ways to fuzz LLVM, and speculate about fuzzer-driven development.",

This talk presents my work to change the algorithm that constructs dominator trees in LLVM and adds new API for performing incremental updates, so maintaining them becomes cheap and easy. Dominator and post-dominator trees are one of the core tools used in numerous analyses and transformations that allow us to reason about the order of execution of basic blocks and instructions. They are used to compute dominance frontier, determine the optimal placement of phi nodes, confirm safety of many transformations like instruction sinking and hoisting. This talk describes the changes that I made to DominatorTree over the past summer and the ongoing efforts to further improve it. First, I will focus on familiarizing the audience with the concept of dominators and their uses. Then I will outline the motivation and implications of the switch to the Semi-NCA[1] algorithm for computing dominators, and the introduction of the Depth Based Search[2] algorithm for performing incremental tree updates. I will also explain the difference between dominators and postdominators, and show why the latter ones are much more tricky than they seem. Finally, we will look at the new API for performing fast and easy batch updates.

      "abstract": "C++ code and large scale scientific programs pose unique challenges when applying high-level loop transformations, which -- together with a push towards robustness and performance-regression freedom -- have been driving the development of Polly over the last two years. In the following presentation we discuss the transformation of Polly towards a scalable, robust and \"regression-free\" loop optimization framework. Correctness is essential when applying loop optimizations at scale. While over the last years, hundreds of bugs and correctness issues have been addressed in Polly, only recently the last fundamental correctness problem was resolved. Even though rarely visible, Polly was for a long time inherently incorrect as it just assumed the integer types it uses for all generated expressions are sufficiently large to hold all possible values. While this assumption was commonly true, similar to how rare corner cases limit most optimizations in LLVM similar corner cases commonly prevent Polly to create code that is correct for all possible inputs. We present a novel framework, which allows Polly to derive after arbitrary loop transformations correct types for each sub-expression or -- if requested -- preconditions under which the needed types are smaller than the native integer type. As a result, a wide range of high-level loop transformations suddenly can be proven correct -- surprisingly -- often without any need for run-time preconditions and at very reasonable Robustness and real-world scalability is the next cornerstone to the optimization of very large programs. In the second part of this presentation we first report on our experience with compiling several large scale programs with Polly: The Android Open Source Project, the COSMO weather and climate model (500,000 LoC and 16,000 loops), as well as the Gentoo package repository. We then discuss a new extension to our internal loop scheduler, which addresses fundamental scalability limitations in our polyhedral scheduler. Traditionally all scheduling choices within a large loop nest have been taken simultaneously, which caused the underlying ILP problem to grow unlimited in dimensionality and as a result limited the scalability of Polly. We present a novel incremental loop scheduling approach, which ensures that the size of the scheduling ILP problems are, independently of the size of the optimized loop nest, bounded. As a result, Polly is not only able to process larger programs, but this freedom can also be exploited to schedule loop programs with sub-basic-block Performance is the last cornerstone we care about. Before improving performance, it is important to ensure to not regress performance. Traditionally, Polly has been running at the beginning of the pass pipeline where the needed additional canonicalization passes caused arbitrary performance changes even in the common case where Polly did not propose any loop transformations. Scalar data dependences introduced by LICM and GVN, prevented Polly to run later in the pass pipeline, a position where no pre-canonicalization is needed and Polly can leave the IR entirely unchanged in case it cannot suggest a beneficial performance optimization. We present with De-LICM a fully automatic approach to remove unneeded scalar dependences, that commonly prevented advanced loop transformations late in the pass pipeline. We conclude by presenting two sets of experimental performance results. First, we used Polly to offload the physics computations of the COSMO weather model, a large scientific code base, to our modern NVIDIA P100 accelerated compute cluster. Second, we discuss how executing Polly late in the pass pipeline enables Polly to improve the performance of linear algebra kernels written with modern C++ expression templates to performance levels reached by tuned libraries such as openblas.",

Various existing implementations of generic programming use either a uniform runtime representation for values (e.g., Java generics) or compile-time monomorphization (e.g., C++, Rust). Swift takes a “dictionary-passing” approach, similar to type-classes in Haskell, using reified type metadata to allow generic code to abstract over the memory layout of data types and avoid boxing. In this talk, we will describe the compilation of Swift’s generics from the type checker down to LLVM IR lowering and interaction with the Swift runtime, illustrating the how the core representation of generics flows through the system, from answering type-checking queries to the calling convention of generic functions and runtime representation of the “dictionaries”.",

Some large systems, including FreeBSD, are switching from GNU ld to lld. lld is usually 10x faster than GNU bfd linker for linking large programs. Even compared to high-performance GNU gold linker, it is still more than 2x faster, yet it is massively simpler than that (26K LOC vs 164K LOC). Because of its simple design, it is easy to add a new feature, port it to a new architecture, or even port it to a new file format such as the WebAssembly object file.

We describe how instruction-level aspects including def/use relations are added to VPlan, and demonstrate their use in modelling masking. In addition, we show how predication decisions can be taken based on an initial VPlan version, and how the resultant masking can be recorded in a transformed VPlan version. This is a first example of a VPlan-to-VPlan transformation, paving the way for better predication and for outer-loop vectorization.

In this talk, we present an other class of compilers: compilers that optimize an ill-defined metric, code obfuscation level. These compilers are generally called code obfuscators and they aim at making it difficult to reverse-engineer the compiled code, while keeping its execution time and its code size within reasonable bounds that may be control by user. Depending on the identified threat (static analysis, dynamic analysis, execution in a virtual machine, in a debugger etc) various counter-measure can be implemented at the compiler level, through direct manipulation of the LLVM-IR, as showcased during the talk: call graph, control flow graph flattening anti-debugging / anti-vm: small code sequences that detect if, for example, the process is being debugged integrity checks, checksums generate intricate, difficult to simplify code sequence in place of simpler ones Of course, these obfuscations may have an important impact on execution time, and some also require informations or features that are not directly available at the LLVM level. This talks walks though various challenges found when building an LLVM bitcode obfuscator: how to inject small to medium size code written in C without relying on an explicit runtime library how to insert end-of-function marker in the code (e.g. to scan for breakpoints, compute code integrity) how to inject checks that depends on information produced by the back-end (relocations, final code, etc) how to create a cross-platform linker wrapper how to cope with incorrect handling of rare patterns (inst combine, vectorization, APInt) This talk is both an introduction to LLVM bitcode obfuscation and a showcase of the limitation/possible improvements of LLVM to support that goal.

It is crucial to ensure that LLVM-based compilers can optimize parallel code, and sometimes the parallelism constructs themselves, as effectively as possible. At last year’s meeting, some of the organizers moderated a BoF that discussed the general issues for parallelism extensions in LLVM IR. Over the past year the organizers have investigated LLVM IR extensions for parallelism and prototyped an infrastructure that enables the effective optimization of parallel code in the context of C/C++/OpenCL. In this BoF, we will discuss several open issues regarding parallelism representations in LLVM with minimal LLVM IR extensions. What would be a minimal set of LLVM IR extensions? What properties are implied by the semantics of these extensions for regions? For example, are restrictions on alloca movement or memory barriers implied? How do we want to express these properties in LLVM IR? How would different parts of LLVM need to be updated to handle these extensions and where is the proper place in the pipeline to lower these constructs? The organizers will explain and share how we have extended our front-end and middle-end passes to produce LLVM IR in with a small set of LLVM IR extensions to represent parallel constructs. As an example, we can discuss how our prototype implementation supports OpenMP-like functionality in OpenCL* to provide enhanced autonomous-driving workload performance",

Our core math library has transitioned to a new C++ interface, the last fundamental correctness issues have been resolved, we scaled Polly to compile COSMO, the Swiss weather model covering over 16.000 loops, and extensive correctness testing has been performed by compiling the full Android Open Source Project, the 500,000 lines COSMO project, as well the gentoo package repository. New techniques to remove scalar dependences allowed us to move Polly late into the pass pipeline and now optimize C++ code as if it would be C code. We started to use hardware information to tune our performance model and even implemented support for the new pass manager. Many things changed over the last year and a growing number of developers and companies continue to actively work on Polly and related technologies. For a lively community working worldwide, meeting and discussing in person is essential to coordinate development efforts. Many of the ideas implemented over the last year were inspired by discussions at the 2016 Polly BoF. For 2017, we expect a variety of new important topics to discuss: Share experience of production use and large-scale research use of Polly How to tighten the integration of Polly within the LLVM community High-level Loop Optimizations on C++ code: where are we, where do we want to go? Accelerator Compilation: Polly to optimize GPGPU and FPGA code Using ILP solvers in LLVM. Can other areas benefit? Which features can they enable? Does it make sense to use Polly’s isl solver, can we improve it, or develop an even better solver?",

Even though accurate and effective modelling of processor details is critical for the performance of the generated code, writing of the model itself is seen by many, especially the ‘uninitiated’, as a highly complex and time consuming task which requires knowledge spanning from architecture design to writing cryptic definitions in TableGen. This tutorial covers the following grounds to help increase the understanding of writing schedulers in LLVM and, furthermore, how to write ‘great schedulers’ : 1. Basics of pipelines in modern processor architectures - topics such as multiple instruction issue, pipeline stages, forwarding or pipeline-bypass, in-order and out-of-order execution and reorder buffers. 2. Basics of the MachineScheduler (the scheduler algorithm of choice in LLVM). 3. How to model architecture pipelines to get optimal performance. 4. Advanced topics – overriding default mechanisms in the scheduler to cater to specific target processor (right from DAG construction to writing a brand new scheduling algorithm).",

We'll ignore the when for now, but in this tutorial we'll dive head first into implementing a GlobalISel backend. Starting with a brief overview of the GlobalISel pipeline, we'll go through concrete examples of how to approach implementing each of the instruction selection phases in a simple backend. As this unfolds, we'll point out some of the gotchas and corner cases you might run into as well as commenting on tools, diagnostics, and the burgeoning best practices of GlobalISel development. At the end of this talk, we hope you'll feel comfortable tackling porting your own backend to GlobalISel.",

We added a new command line interface with the `--autocomplete` flag to which a shell or an IDE can pass an incomplete clang invocation. Clang then returns a list of possible flag completions and their descriptions. To improve these completions, we also extended clang’s data structures with information about the values of each flag. For example, when asking bash to autocomplete the invocation `clang -fno-sanitize-coverage=`, bash is now able to list all values that sanitize coverage accepts. Since LLVM 5.0 release, you can always get an accurate list of flags and their values, any time on any further clang version behind a highly portable interface. As a first shell implementation, we built a bash-completion plugin that uses this API, and we’re soon be bringing this feature to other shells. There are other third-party projects that are interested in using this API as well.",

To solve this problem we present our work on a CMake toolkit for modularizing C++ projects: it ships with a large variety of module maps that are automatically mounted when the corresponding system library is used by the project. It also assists with modularizing the project’s own headers and performs checks that the current module setup does not cause the build process itself to fail. And last but not least: it requires only trivial changes to integrate into real-world build systems, allowing the migration of larger projects to clang’s module system in a matter of hours.",

      "abstract": "It is well understood that programs spend most of their time in loops. The application writer may want to know the measure of time-taken for each loop in large programs, so that (s)he can then focus on these loops for applying optimizations. Loop profiling is a way to calculate loop-based run-time information such as execution-time, cache-miss equations and other runtime metrics, which help us to analyze code to fix performance related issues in the code base. This is achieved by instrumenting/annotating the existing input program. There already exist loop-profilers for conventional languages like C++, Java etc., both in open-source and commercial domain. However, as far as we know, there is no such loop-profiler available for LLVM-IR; such a tool would help LLVM users analyze loops in LLVM-IR. Our work mainly focuses around developing such a generic loop profiler for LLVM-IR. It can thus be used for any language(s) which have a LLVM IR. Our current work proposes an LLVM based loop-profiler which works on the IR level and gives execution times, and total number of clocks for each loop. Currently, we focus on the inner-most loop(s) as well as each individual loop(s) for collecting run-time profiling data. Our profiler works on LLVM IR and inserts the instrumented code into the entry and exit blocks of each loop. It also returns the number of clock(s) ticks and execution time(s) for each loop of the input program. It also append(s) some instrumented code into the exit block of outer-most loop for calculating total and average number of clocks for each loop. We are currently working to capture other runtime metrics like number of cache misses, number of registers required. We have results from SPEC CPU 2006 which demonstrate that for all benchmarks in the suite, very few loops are highly compute intensive. For most of the other loops, either control does not reach to them, or they take negligible execution time.",

      "abstract": "While building a LLVM toolchain is simple and straightforward process, building a cross-toolchain (i.e. a toolchain capable of targeting different targets) is often a complicated, multi-stage endeavor. This process has recently became much simpler due to improvements in the runtimes build, which enables cross-compiling runtimes for multiple targets as part of a single build. In this lightning talk, I will show to build a complete cross-toolchain using a single CMake invocation.",

      "abstract": "The future of automatic vectorization in LLVM lies in Intel's VPlan proposal. The current VPlan patches provide the basic scaffolding for outer loop vectorization. However, the advanced analyses and transformations to execute VPlans are yet missing. The Region Vectorizer (RV) is an automatic vectorization framework for LLVM. RV provides a unified interface to vectorize code regions, such as inner and outer loops, up to whole functions. RV's analysis and transformations are designed to create highly efficient SIMD code. These are the exact the analyses and transformations that are needed for VPlan. This talk presents a proposal for integrating RV with VPlan.",

      "abstract": "Polly, the polyhedral analysis and optimization framework of LLVM, is designed and developed as an --- external --- project. While recently attempts have been made to make the analysis results available to common LLVM passes, the different pass pipelines and the very design of Polly make this an almost impossible task. In order to make polyhedral value, memory and dependence analysis information available to LLVM passes we propose the Polyhedral Value Analysis (PVA) and the Polyhedral Memory Analysis (PMA). Both are first class LLVM passes that provide a Scalar Evolution like experience with a polyhedral model backbone. The analyses are demand driven, caching, flow sensitive and variably scoped (aka. optimistic). In addition this approach can easily be extended to an inter-procedural setting.",

      "abstract": "Deep learning software demands performance and reliability. However, many of the current deep learning tools and infrastructures are highly dependent on software libraries that act as a dynamic DSL and a computation graph interpreter. We present DLVM, a design and implementation of a compiler framework that consists of linear algebra operators, automatic differentiation, domain-specific optimizations and a code generator targeting heterogeneous parallel hardware. DLVM is designed to support the development of neural network DSLs, with both AOT and JIT compilation. To demonstrate an end-to-end system from neural network DSL, via DLVM, to parallelized execution, we demonstrate NNKit, a typed tagless-final DSL embedded in the Swift programming language that targets DLVM IR. We argue that the DLVM system enables a form of modular, safe and performant toolkits for deep learning.",
