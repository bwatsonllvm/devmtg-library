Moreover, both quick prototyping and deep integration with client frameworks calls for uses of different languages to work with MLIR, most often Python for its simplicity and C for its ubiquity. This talk will present the MLIR C API and demonstrate how it is used to construct Python bindings. Attendees of this talk will learn how to expose custom dialects in both C and Python as well as how to leverage C API to interact with MLIR from different languages",

Compiler features like “Stack Protector”, “Safe Stack” , and “Stack Clash Protection” can help protect code from common programmer mistakes and thwart malicious actors trying to take advantage of buggy code. However, even the most sophisticated protection can be rendered useless if the compiler itself can’t be delivered safely to its users. In this talk we take a look at LLVM’s approach to supply chain security. How we get code from a developer’s desk safely into the hands of users. We’ll look at our release process, our access policies, and our project infrastructure to see how we are approaching supply chain security and what we can do to make it better.",

Are these the signs of MLIR reaching a certain maturity level? Or are these the warning signs of the worrying community disengagement? Should we declare MLIR feature-complete and redirect larger changes to client projects or, on the contrary, actively lift the common parts from downstreams? What is preventing individuals and teams from collaborating more actively in the open? This panel brings together leaders from academia, start-ups and established industry players to discuss their takes on these and other hot questions about MLIR strategy.",

The talk highlights the inherent complexities of generating SPIR-V, a higher-level representation compared to LLVM IR, through conventional GlobalISel translation schema. Key issues such as the translation of opaque pointers, pointer and builtin type inference, and the integration of new SPIR-V extensions are discussed. The session will cover strategies for ensuring backward compatibility with older LLVM IR, maintaining [g]MIR correctness across passes, and verifying SPIR-V binaries through GitHub actions using existing LIT tests and external tools. Plans to further integrate SPIR-V into LLVM with a new frontend are also presented.",

In this talk, we aim to take a different approach by identifying patterns and types of loops that the loop vectoriser cannot vectorise. Specifically, we want to: i) identify the deficiencies and missing features of the loop vectoriser, ii) group these deficiencies and find common root causes for missed vectorisation opportunities, and iii) develop a vectorisation plan to enhance code-generation quality based on these insights. Therefore, the contributions of this work and talk include: 1. A quantitative approach to find loop vectorisation opportunities and evaluate deficiencies, 2. A presentation of benchmark numbers for two loop-based benchmarks TSVC-2 and RAJAPerf, 3. A first analysis of loop vectoriser deficiencies and opportunities. 4. Thoughts on measuring and evaluating compiler changes with the LLVM test-suite. Although we concentrated on AArch64 platforms for our results, most of your findings are broadly applicable.",

In this follow-up session, we will explore the implementation details of the Linalg Vectorizer, focusing on how it handles Linalg operations beyond linalg.matmul, which was covered in the previous talk. We'll also compare various vectorization pre-processing strategies—such as masking, peeling, and padding—and demonstrate how to effectively apply these strategies. Additionally, we will address the unique challenges posed by scalable vectors, including our approach to extending value-bounds analysis to accommodate these complexities. Specifically, we'll provide an update on the ongoing support for the Scalable Matrix Extension (SME), a CPU extension that enables 2D scalable vectors.",

Debug information can make up to 90% of an object file, therefore, efficiently handling it is paramount for the size of a build cache, and its replay speed. This year, we further improved the size of debug information by redesigning the CAS schema, and applying compression.

Allocations result in \"virtual pointers\" that are checked and translated prior to accesses but without buffer zones and, in case of shared and local GPU memory, even without additional memory traffic. Our performance results show huge advantages against the classic CPU design ported to the GPU, however, we will details various pitfalls that make efficient sanitization of GPU code especially hard. Finally, we will show some initial comparison of this design against classic ASAN on the CPU.",

Expressing these algorithms at this level, rather than using the low-level SIMT (Single Instruction, Multiple Threads) model, presents a significant challenge for kernel developers. In this talk, we will demonstrate how Mojo, a systems programming language built on MLIR, addresses this challenge through its powerful metaprogramming capabilities. Mojo enables the creation of simple yet powerful composable abstractions for parametric Tensor types, which can be tiled, distributed across the compute hierarchy, and vectorized. Additionally, the language provides GPU library authors with direct access to MLIR, making it easier for library authors to specialize high-level library operations for specific hardware targets, which facilitates the efficient development of state-of-the-art GPU kernels that outperform vendor libraries like cuBLAS.",

In this talk we will present the current status of Pointer Authentication ABI for ELF platforms, its components, their specifics and the different choices that platform should make to deploy the said ABI. We will also discuss the required changes that platforms must undertake beyond the compiler toolchain and present some proofs of concept implementations based on the Musl library.",

Our contributions include eliminating fallbacks in GISel, particularly for the TSVC-2 benchmark, by introducing patches across the phases of GISel. We also present our work on optimizations of GISel’s generated code which has significantly closed the performance gap between GISel and SelectionDAG on Advanced SIMD-based AArch64 platforms, especially for the TSVC-2 benchmark.

XeTile demonstrates that with a few critical extensions, MLIR dialects can be used as building blocks to support deep learning compiler development for high-performant code generation. With the \"Tile\" data type and a few operations, XeTile dialect greatly simplifies the lowering of dense operations. Any tile-based GEMM-like algorithms can easily be expressed in a few lines of code, including advanced optimizations like cooperative load/prefetch, K-slicing, and software pipelining.",

As part of the talk, we will also examine how to perform semantic analysis, code generation, and constant evaluation on XLG. Furthermore, we will demonstrate how these tasks can be performed in an extensible manner, allowing the introduction of new semantics rules or constructs as plugins. Finally, we present how to interoperate XLG with existing dialects and leverage existing MLIR passes to handle often tricky programming notions like meta-programming.",
