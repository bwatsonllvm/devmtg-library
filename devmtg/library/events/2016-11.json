The past two years have seen changes to the metadata representation itself (e.g. distinct vs. uniqued metadata), as well as new metadata that specify pointer alignment, dereferenceability, control loop optimizations, and more. Several new attributes and intrinsics allow for more-detailed control over pointer-aliasing and control-flow properties, and new intrinsics to support masked and scatter/gather memory accesses have been added. Support for older features, such as fast-math flags and the returned attribute, have been significantly extended. I'll explain the semantics of many of these new features, their intended uses, and a few ways they shouldn't be used. Finally, I'll discuss how Clang exposes and leverages these new features to encourage the generation of higher-performance code.",

More and more languages adopt them to deal with lazily produced sequences and to simplify asynchronous programming. However, until recently, coroutines in high level languages were distinctly not a zero-overhead abstraction. We are rectifying that by adding coroutine support to LLVM that allows, finally, for high-level language to have efficient coroutines In this talk, we will look at coroutine examples in C++ and LLVM IR, at optimization passes that deal with coroutines and at LLVM coroutine representation that C++ and other frontend can use to describe coroutines to LLVM. LLVM coroutines are functions that can suspend their execution and return control back to their callers. Suspended coroutines can be resumed to continue execution when desired. Though coroutine support in LLVM is motivated primarily by the desire to support C++ Coroutines, the LLVM coroutine representation is language neutral and can be used to support coroutines in other languages as well.",

SIMD and DECLARE SIMD constructs introduced in OpenMP4.0 and enhanced in OpenMP4.5 are gaining popularity among performance hungry programmers due to the ability to specify a vectorization region much larger in scope than the traditional inner loop auto-vectorization would handle and also due to several advanced vectorizing compilers delivering impressive performance for such constructs. Hence, there is a growing interest in LLVM developer community in improving LoopVectorizer in order to adequately support OpenMP functionalities such as outer loop vectorization and whole function vectorization. In this Technical Talk, we discuss our approaches in achieving that goal through a series of incremental steps and further extending it for outer loop auto-vectorization.",

Its core component, revamb, is a static binary translator which aims is to translate a Linux program compiled for any of the 17 ISAs supported by QEMU and produce an equivalent binary for a, possibly different, architecture supported by the LLVM compiler framework. revamb aims to translate and re-optimize legacy/closed source programs but can also be employed for a number of security-related purposes, such as retrofitting binary hardening techniques (e.g., CFI) or instrumenting existing binaries with good performance figures (e.g., for black box fuzzing purposes). More in general, rev.ng can be used to perform binary analysis on a wide range of architectures in the comfortable LLVM environment. As an example, rev.ng can be used to recover high-level information such as an accurate CFG and function boundaries from a binary program. At its current status, revamb is able to successfully translate the 105 coreutils binaries compiled for ARM, x86-64 and MIPS and pass over 80% of coreutils's testsuite on all of them. The programs have been linked statically, therefore they include handwritten assembly and their text is in the order of the hundreds of kilobytes.",

The main goal of code-hoisting is to reduce code size with the added benefit of exposing more instruction level parallelism and reduced register pressure. We present a code hoisting pass that we implemented in llvm. It is based on Global Value Numbering infrastructure available in llvm. The experimental results show an average of 2.5\\% savings in code size, although the code size increases in many cases because it enables more inlining. This is an optimistic algorithm in the sense that we consider all identical computations in a function as potential candidates to be hoisted. We make an extra effort to hoist candidates by partitioning the potential candidates in a way to enable partial hoisting in case common hoisting points for all the candidates cannot be found. We also formalize cases when register pressure will reduce as a result of hoisting.",

FM has seen a significant increase in usage in software over the past decade, being used in critical system design, security, and prototyping. We will discuss the benefits and drawbacks of LLVM IR for FM and the need for an Abstract Representation (AR) that allows for the analysis via engineering approximations. In particular we want to talk about our approach and tools that mapped our chosen AR, developed at NASA, and then extending our initial set of analysis into more logical and hierarchal relationship. Lastly we want to present what we feel are the difficulties, future challenges and successes of FM tools integrating with LLVM community.",

Be it the infamous high/low 8 bit registers of X86, the 32/64bit addressing modes of X86-64 and AArch64 or GPUs with wide loads and stores where with computation on sub register lanes. LLVM recently gained support to track liveness on subregister granularity. In combination with improved heuristics for register classes of varying sizes the average register count decreased for 20% for GPU shader programs. This talk gives an introduction to typical situations benefiting from sub register liveness modeling. It shows how a target architecture developer can model them and explains the register allocation techniques employed by llvm.",

More than that, though, there is a world of Windows tools, such as profilers, post-mortem crash analyzers, self-debugging tools (dbghelp), and symbol servers, that makes it really worth implementing CodeView support in LLVM. Since the last dev meeting, we've been hard at work studying the format and slowly adding support for it to LLVM. This talk will give an overview of the format, and then go back and focus on the aspects that most impacted our design decisions in Clang and LLVM. As others in the community have discovered while working on LTO, LLDB, modules, and llvm-dsymutil, type information can often end up being the dominating factor in the performance of the toolchain. CodeView has some interesting design choices for solving that problem that I will share. I will close by talking about where we want to go in the future, and how we will eventually use LLD to package our CodeView into a PDB file.",

      "abstract": "There are many embedded systems on which we rely heavily in our day to day lives, and for these it is crucial to ensure that these systems are as robust as possible. To this end, it is important to have strong guarantees about the integrity of running code. Achieving this naturally requires close integration between hardware features and compiler toolchain support for these features. To achieve this, an NXP architecture uses hardware signing to ensure integrity of a program's control flow from modification. Each instruction's interpretation depends on the preceding instruction in the execution flow (and hence the sequence of all preceding instructions). Basic blocks require a \"correction value\" to bring the system into a consistent state when arriving from different predecessors. Compiler support is needed for this such that compiled code can receive the benefits of this feature. Over the past year we have implemented the infrastructure for this feature which can be enabled on a per-function level in LLVM, for functions written in both C and/or assembly. In this talk we will present this system, and show how it enforces control flow integrity. We will explain how we have extended our target's backend with a pass that produces metadata describing a system's control flow. This allows branches and calls to be resolved with appropriate correction values. A particular challenge is dealing with function pointers and hence indirect transfers of control. We will also describe the implementation of user attributes to support such functionality in Clang. The encoding of each instruction, and the correction values cannot be finally determined until the final programs is linked. Using the metadata generated by LLVM, we can recreate the control flow graph for the entire program. From this, each instruction can be signed, and the correction values for each basic block inserted into the binary. We will finish with a demonstration of this system in action.
