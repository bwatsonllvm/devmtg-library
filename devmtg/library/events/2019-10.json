Recently, attention has turned towards optimization and bringing it to the point where it can take over from SelectionDAGISel. In this talk, we'll mainly focus on the combiner which is a key component of producing optimized code with GlobalISel. We'll talk about the overall design of the combiner, the components that support it, how it fits with the rest of GlobalISel, how to test it, and how to debug it. We'll also talk about the current and future work on the combiner to enhance it beyond SelectionDAGISel’s capabilities.",

LLVM is well known for supporting JIT compilation, and moreover, Clang, LLVM's best-in-class C++ frontend, enables the highly-optimized compilation of C++ code. Clang, however, uses purely an ahead-of-time compilation model, and so we leave on the table performance which might come from dynamic specialization. In this talk, I'll describe ClangJIT, an enhancement to Clang, and an extension to the C++ language, which brings JIT-compilation capabilities to the C++ ecosystem. Critically, ClangJIT enables the dynamic, incremental creation of new template instantiations. This can provide important performance benefits, and in addition, can decrease overall application compile times. I'll describe how Clang was enhanced to support this feature - what I needed to do to turn Clang into an incremental C++ compilation library - and how LLVM's JIT infrastructure was leveraged. ClangJIT supports Clang's CUDA mode, and how that works will be described. Some application use cases will be highlighted and I'll discuss some future directions.",

In addition to exporting the full power of LLVM's SIMD functionality, novel Zig features such as comptime are also provided for vector intrinsics. We show that LLVM and Zig enable a new single libmvec implementation, instead of the many currently in use and in development.",

Alive2 is a re-implementation of Alive that removes several limitations of the previous tool. It supports floating point operations and has better support for memory and loops. It handles optimizations beyond those found in InstCombine. It includes a standalone tool that can prove equivalence / refinement between two bitcode functions as well as an `opt` plugin that can prove that an LLVM optimization is correct. Neither of these new tools requires optimizations to be rewritten in the Alive DSL. In this talk, we will give an overview on Alive2 and show how you can use it to 1) ensure your optimization is correct, and 2) to find that bug that is triggering a miscompilation.",

Given an LLVM IR as an input, Souper tries to generate peephole patterns by synthesizing semantically equivalent but shorter instruction sequences. However, as a platform-independent framework, it lacks a model of the actual cost of an instruction sequence on the target machine. This leads to missing optimizations opportunities or generation of peephole patterns which degrade performance. In this talk, we’re going to demonstrate how Souper can benefit from target machine information. Then, we will explore some possible approaches to providing Souper with target machine info to steer the superoptimizer to find more patterns with improvements than regressions. This will enable Souper to be used in a more automated way and reduce the manual intervention required.",

      "abstract": "The code size of iOS apps is critical due to the size limit of apple store. More and more iOS apps are written in Swift. The Swift programming language provides many new language features such as protocol to facilitate software development. In order to support the implementation of these new features, the existing Swift compiler has to generate the protocol related code and data. However, these generated code and data may not be used in the whole project. For example, some protocol definition is used one module as public and not really consumed by any other modules. Preliminary experiment shows the size of some commercial iOS app can be potentially reduced by 9% through aggressive dead code elimination. Those unused code and data cannot be eliminated easily by the compiler optimizations since they are recorded in llvm.used data structure. In addition, the generated code and data might be implicitly used by Swift runtime library. This calls for a smarter, much more advanced static analysis and novel additions to the classic dead code elimination technique. We introduce a novel building pipeline that eliminates the protocol from swift class by leveraging the link time optimization in existing LLVM compiler. In this framework, the swift files are first compiled as LLVM bitcode files and the llvm-link is used to merge all the LLVM bitcode files as one bitcode file. A new LLVM optimization is proposed to eliminate the protocol conformance related variables from the LLVM.used array in this bitcode file. It enables more opportunities for link time optimization to transform global variables into local variables and then identify the dead local variables. The following dead code elimination is extended to update the protocol conformance tables as well as LLVM.used array. The experiment shows that this novel approach reduces the code size of some commercial iOS app by 2%.",

The hot/cold splitting pass identifies cold basic blocks and moves them into separate functions. The linker can then put newly-created cold functions away from the rest of the program . The idea here is to have these cold pages faulted in relatively infrequently, and to improve the memory locality of code outside of the cold area. The algorithm is novel in the sense it is based on region and implemented at the IR level. Because it is implemented at the IR level, all the backend targets benefit from this implementation. Other implementations of hot-cold splitting outline each basic block separately and are implemented at the RTL level.",

As this language mode is fully backwards compatible with OpenCL C 2.0, existing OpenCL applications can gradually switch to using C++ features without any major modifications. During the implementation the strategy was chosen to generalize features that exist in a range of accelerator devices to C++. For example, address space support was improved in C++ to be used as a language extension and OpenCL functionality was built on top of it. This was done to take advantage of common logic in some language features among multiple C++ dialects and extensions that are available in Clang. At the end of the talk we will describe the future roadmap. Some documentation has been started in Clang.

      "abstract": "Comparing intermediate representation dumps after various transformations can be extremely laborious. This is especially true when reasoning through differences in shaders or compute modules which have undergone several optimization passes. Most of these differences tend to be semantically equivalent and are just a consequence of irregular instruction ordering and naming. In the need to save time we have developed a tool called llvm-canon which transforms the code into a canonical form. Thereby in ideal conditions, canonicalized semantically identical code should result in a clear diff, making important semantic differences stand out. The challenges we faced during the development of this project gave us many sleepless nights. Puzzling over the right point of reference for canonicalization, calculating the odds of similarity, and finding the golden mean between precision and being human-friendly resulted in a very useful tool. A tool with broad possibilities for further expansion and improvements. In this talk I will go through countless ideas for what is known today as llvm-canon (including ditched ones). Discuss the algorithms behind all the transformations, including instruction reordering and all the magic behind naming values. Yet more importantly I will demonstrate the benefits of diffing canonical code and what we have learned from this interesting experiment.",

Reference counting operations are usually introduced as part of lowering to the compiler's IR as, e.g., calls to builtins or library functions, but this approach leads to both missed optimization opportunities (if the presence of these calls inhibit optimizations) and correctness bugs (if optimizations reason about reference-counting incorrectly). In Swift, we have mitigated these problems by changing the Swift Intermediate Language (SIL) to express statically verifiable ownership constraints on def-use chains defining an augmented form of SSA called Ownership SSA (OSSA). OSSA has yielded many benefits such as improved frontend correctness/verification and the implementation of safer, more aggressive reference counting optimizations. The improvements allowed by OSSA may be of interest to other developers of high level languages that use reference counting memory management.",

It will briefly explain the construction of the ExplodedGraph during symbolic execution, and how it will be processed after the analysis. Using a combination of data and control dependency analysis with the help of the inspection of the ExplodedGraph, the analyzer tries to construct user friendly diagnostics. Since symbolic execution is a kind of path sensitive analysis, the idea behind the solution the analyzer employs is general enough to create diagnostics for other kinds of analyses.

Those tutorials are not only helpful for unaffiliated beginners, but can also help onboard new employees as well as provide insights for experienced LLVM developers into parts of the project we are not familiar with. To start this effort, we wrote three new tutorials with supporting documentation: ’My First Typo Fix“ (explaining the end-to-end development workflow), ’My First Clang Warning“ , and ’My First Clang/LLVM Tutorial“ (showcasing the contents of this talk), with more tutorials to come. To scale this effort of creating new tutorials and cover most parts of the LLVM project, we need to engage more members of the LLVM community to join us. We will share our experience of writing and testing the tutorials we created and give recommendations on how to write beginner-friendly, inclusive tutorials for the LLVM project.",

Which aspects of our methodology should others adopt? Are there opportunities to improve LLVM to make it easier to bring up new backends? Or opportunities to better share tests? How can we make it easier for language frontends like Rust to support new targets?",

ASTImporter imports nodes of an AST context into another AST context. Existing clients of the ASTImporter library are Cross Translation Unit (CTU) static analysis and the LLDB expression parser. CTU static analysis imports a definition of a function if its definition is found in another translation unit (TU). This way the analysis can breach out from the single TU limitation. LLDB’s \"expr\" command parses a user-defined expression, creates an ASTContext for that and then imports the missing definitions from the AST what we got from the debug information (DWARF, etc).",

We will also try the new, Polly-inspired plugin registration mechanism (based on a patch not yet merged upstream at the point of writing this abstract).

The Loop and LoopInfo classes are being continually improved, as are supporting data structures such as the Data Dependence Graph (DDG) and Program Dependence Graph (PDG). The pass manager infrastructure (both New and Legacy pass managers) provide infrastructure to write both function passes and loop passes. However, putting all of these concepts together to write a functioning loop optimization pass can still be a somewhat daunting task. This tutorial will start by introducing basic terminology that is used within LLVM to describe loops (for example, many of the concepts introduced in https://reviews.llvm.org/D65164). It will then look at the Loop and LoopInfo classes, and go over the interfaces they have to work with loops. It will provide examples of how these classes can be used to implement different types of loop optimizations, using examples from both the Loop Fusion and Loop Distribution passes. It will discuss the differences between a function pass and a loop pass, including a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of each one when writing loop optimizations. It will also provide guidance on when each type of pass should be used. Finally, it will go through many of the useful utility functions that need to be used in order to write a loop optimization efficiently (e.g., updating the dominator tree, updating Scalar Evolution, etc.).",

The framework, as well as the deduced information which does not directly translate to LLVM-IR attributes, can be used for various other purposes where information about the code is required. In this talk we will give an overview about the design, showcase current and future use cases, discuss the interplay with other (inter-procedural) passes, highlight ongoing and future extensions, and finally present an evolution. Actual deduction (and use) of attributes will be described but also discussed in our lighting talk presentations and poster.",

Since inlining is not always possible (recursion, parallel programs, ...) or beneficial (large functions), the effort to improve IPO has recently seen an upswing again. In order to capitalize this momentum, we would like to talk about the current situation in LLVM, and goals for the immediate, but also distant, future. We will ask our expert panel questions as follows: What are the current and potential problems with IPO? How does the new pass manager impact IPO? Is function cloning & IPO as an alternative to inlining? How does the desired (new PM) pipeline differ from what we have right now? How is, and how should, IPO interact with (thin-)LTO and PGO? What are the most desirable IPO analyses and optimizations we are lacking today? This guided panel discussion is a follow-up to the BoF at EuroLLVM'19. Both experts and newcomers are welcome to attend. Questions can be send to the organizers prior to the conference to allow consideration.",

      "abstract": "By design, LLVM backend infrastructure is geared towards classical register-based architectures. Thus, adapting it to a stack machine implies additional LLVM passes that are likely to vary depending on a target. For instance, the Selection DAG cannot produce instructions that directly handle the stack. Instead, it selects a relevant instruction version designed to work with registers. Then, MIR passes are performed to insert stack manipulations (pushes, pops, exchanges) and to convert instructions handling virtual registers into those handling stack slots. The suggested logic seems quite generic and not limited to a specific stack-based virtual machine. It is similar to other optimizations and analytical approaches that can be applied to stack machines regardless of the specific instruction set. Previously, WebAssembly was the only implementation that needed a comprehensive stackification logic, now we created an option for the TON virtual machine (TVM). Given that stack machines are great for binary size minimization, stackification solutions are likely to face demand from other domains. So, we would love to discuss whether or not the community needs generic algorithms that can be integrated with various backends and if stack-machine support might benefit the target-independent code generator.",

Compiler warnings are one of the best static-analysis tools we could have, so we would like to use it to the fullest. I’ll share some interesting bugs that were found as a result of enabling ‘-Wall’ in a large codebase. While some of them were funny and benign, some were really critical bugs hidden in the codebase.

Clang provides a header file containing all declarations, but unfortunately parsing this header file takes several seconds per OpenCL program. Ameliorating the parsing time by precompiling the header file has several drawbacks: the resulting PCH file is several megabytes large and requires special handling for macros and conditional compilation. We present a new TableGen driven approach to support all OpenCL builtins in a fast and compact manner. TableGen generates a trie and tables for recognising and constructing function declarations. From this, Clang constructs the necessary builtin function declarations when a regular name lookup fails and retries the lookup. This approach avoids the need to parse the opencl-c.h header or populate the symbol table with 1000s of declarations. The generated tables and functions together take less than 250 kilobytes which is significantly smaller than the PCH approach. The initial patches of this work have been committed (e.g. r362371) and the remainder of the implementation is currently being upstreamed and reviewed.",

In this talk I will discuss the process of enabling these optimizations for RISC-V, and explain the various decisions that were made. I will show benchmarking results for each technique, and talk about potential changes that could improve the results.",

The debug server is capable of very simple operations, such as reading/writing registers and memory, starting and single-stepping the processor and reporting back when the processor halts. The two communicate with each other using a very simple text based serial protocol. The GNU debugger has long been served by a number of debug server options, including the gdbserver program for Linux class embedded systems and tools such as OpenOCD for deeply embedded systems. LLDB is not so well served, even though it uses an almost identical protocol to talk to the debug server. In most cases, the built in lldb-server program is used for this purpose, but this is ill suited for bare metal applications on embedded platforms. We present a new free and open source debug server for deeply embedded systems which fully supports LLDB. It is capable of controlling the simplest hardware, through to complex multicore heterogenous architectures. In particular, it can also run in lockstep mode, where two targets (for example an architectural model and a hardware implementation) are controlled together, to identify any points where behavior diverges.",

This is true both in standard compilation but also link-time-optimization (LTO) in which the module is (partially) merged with others in the same project at link time. LTO is able to take advantage of this to optimize functions calls to outside the translation unit. However, LTO doesn't solve the problem for two reasons of practicality: LTO comes with a nontrivial compile-time investment; and many libraries upon which a program could depend, do not ship with LTO information, simply headers and binaries. In this extended abstract, we solve the problem by generating annotated versions of the source code that also include this derived information. Such an approach has the benefits of both worlds: allowing optimizations previously limited to LTO without running LTO and only providing headers. Such headers are created by modifying Clang to understand three custom attributes to represent arbitrary LLVM function attributes and modifying LLVM to emit C-compatible headers with the aforementioned attribute. Finally, we test the approach experimentally on the DOE RSBench proxy application and verify that it provides the expected speedups.",

The debug server is capable of very simple operations, such as reading/writing registers and memory, starting and single-stepping the processor and reporting back when the processor halts. The two communicate with each other using a very simple text based serial protocol. The GNU debugger has long been served by a number of debug server options, including the gdbserver program for Linux class embedded systems and tools such as OpenOCD for deeply embedded systems. LLDB is not so well served, even though it uses an almost identical protocol to talk to the debug server. In most cases, the built in lldb-server program is used for this purpose, but this is ill suited for bare metal applications on embedded platforms. We present a new free and open source debug server for deeply embedded systems which fully supports LLDB. It is capable of controlling the simplest hardware, through to complex multicore heterogenous architectures. In particular, it can also run in lockstep mode, where two targets (for example an architectural model and a hardware implementation) are controlled together, to identify any points where behavior diverges.",

      "abstract": "Using the ORC JIT APIs we have developed support for speculative compilation. This feature aims to use early compilation on dedicated additional threads to hide compilation latency in the JIT'd program without interfering with execution. Speculative decisions are made based on the branch probability of control flow graphs which is derived from static heuristics and IR instrumentation based profiling of JIT'd code. We have seen a consistent reduction in compilation overhead experienced by the execution thread. Finally, we will show our results for selected applications.",

      "abstract": "Instrumentation tools often focus on single tasks, such as gathering performance numbers or detecting race conditions. While gathering important information for the user, these tools are not often designed to allow the end-user a more general code exploration as executed. Loom is a framework for general-purpose instrumentation and transformation of software in the LLVM intermediate representation. Loom provides both a standalone tool and a library with an API designed to allow for the implementation of custom instrumentation passes. Loom's current functionality is presented, including real-world applications for Loom in a recent research project. We present comparisons of both performance and functionality of Loom to existing instrumentation tools, including X-Ray, CSI, D-Trace and Intel Pin. Finally, we will present security use cases that are not addressed by any of these instrumentation tools and are the motivation for new Loom developments.",
