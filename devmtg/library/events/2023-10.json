In practice, quantum devices are controlled by systems of classical, real-time hardware. To execute a quantum program it is therefore necessary to compile the quantum program to the target classical hardware, which in turn emits and receives the signals that control and measure a quantum device. This talk will present a brief introduction to quantum computing and an overview of the compilation tools used to compile a quantum program to run on quantum hardware. Both MLIR and LLVM are found at the heart of these compiler tools, including a new MLIR dialect, QUIR, for Quantum programs, quantum-specific optimizations performed on QUIR, and the traditional LLVM infrastructure to do much of the final code generation. This talk will focus on how quantum programs flow through this compiler and are converted into instructions to enable some of the first quantum experiments with real-time control-flow to run on superconducting qubits.",

However, key properties of LLVM dominance (e.g. if A dominates B, then variables live in A continue to be live in B) need not be true in MLIR. We provide such examples of under-specification in MLIR, and propose potential ways forward that warrant discussion.",

It will go over various interesting design choices like performance and ABI considerations. To enable use in different contexts (e.g. testing vs production) with varying performance characteristics, the library provides different levels of hardening which make different performance/safety tradeoffs. Libc++ hardening modes turn library-level undefined behavior into reliable program termination. For example, indexing into a vector using an out-of-bounds index normally leads to undefined behavior (in practice, it can either go undetected or result in a segmentation fault). When hardening is enabled in libc++, the same incorrect usage will instead result in a reliable program termination, making the bug easier to find during testing and more difficult to exploit in case the bug isn't caught during testing.",

In particular, we present a translation-validation tool for MLIR, to check the correctness of the compilation of a given program. We also present a tool that automatically checks the correctness of a PDL program (extended to work with analysis passes), by lowering a PDL program to the `smt` dialect. Finally, we provide extra support for handling analysis passes with the use of an `analysis` dialect. This dialect allows users to write dataflow analysis passes as MLIR programs, and then verify both the correctness and the optimality of the analysis using the `smt` dialect, as well as generating the C++ code that can be used by the dataflow analysis framework.",

The ORC API can be generalized further to make use of the profiling metrics and \"reoptimize\" the function hiding the reoptimization latency. For instance, one of the many applications of this technique is to compile functions at a lower optimization level for faster compilation speed and then reoptimize them to a higher level when those functions are frequently executed. This talk we demonstrate how we can express lazy JIT, speculative compilation, and re-optimization as \"\"symbol redirection\"\" problems. We demonstrate the improved ORC API for redirecting symbols. In addition, this technical talk will peek at internal details of how we implemented re-optimization support and showcase the demos such as real time clang-repl re-optimization from -O0 to -O3 or real time virtual call optimization through de-virtualization.",

In this talk we explore how to efficiently store DWARF debug information in a CAS (Content Addressable Storage). By isolating each function's debug info contribution into its own CAS Object, we can reduce the overall size of the debug information in incremental builds drastically. This can be achieved by emitting DWARF that is more \"split-able\" while ensuring that we abide by the DWARF standard and do not lose any information in the process. We will discuss the efficacy of this approach when comparing against a file-based build cache such as ccache.",

At the same time, large amounts of data can also become overwhelming and distract from the useful information behind it. The CHAOSS open source project was created to help define metrics to measure activity, find out more about bottlenecks and root causes of issues in open source projects, and more, while also helping people to understand how they can use the available metrics. This session will provide a high-level overview of the CHAOSS project and metrics. Attendees will learn about the challenges of collecting and analyzing data, and practices to overcome them.

      "abstract": "In many ways Python and C++ represent the two ends in the spectrum of programming languages. C++ has an important role in the field of computing as the language design principles promote efficiency, reliability and backward compatibility – a vital tripod for any long-lived codebase. Python has prioritized better usability and safety while making some tradeoffs on efficiency and backward compatibility. That has led developers to believe that there is a binary choice between performance and usability. Python has become the language of data science and machine learning in particular while C++ still is the language of voice for performance-critical software. The C++ and Python ecosystems are vast and achieving seamless interoperability between them is essential to avoid risky software rewrites. In this talk we leverage our decade-old experience in writing automatic Python to C++ bindings. We demonstrate how we could connect the Python interpreter to the new in-tree C++ interpreter called Clang-Repl. We show how we can build a uniform execution environment between both languages using the new compiler-as-a-service (CaaS) API available in Clang. The execution environment enables advanced interoperability such as the ability for Python to instantiate C++ templates on demand, inherit from C++ classes or catch std::exception. We show how CaaS can be connected to external services such as Jupyter and execute code written in both languages.",

Vectorisation is a key optimisation in enabling this performance and MLIR is no exception. In this presentation, we will give an overview of a high-level vectorisation approach that leverages one of the main abstractions available in MLIR: the Linalg Dialect. We will also discuss how it can be used to support Arm's Scalable Vector and Scalable Matrix Extensions (SVE and SME, respectively) in MLIR. The Linalg Vectoriser combines a simple tiling + basic-block vectorisation approach with advanced vectorisation concepts such as scalable vectors, vector masking and multi-dimensional vectorisation. This presentation will provide an overview of the design and how it differs from traditional vectorizers. You will also see how the Linalg Vectoriser can be used to generate highly-optimised kernels for ubiquitous operations like matrix-matrix multiplication and convolutions. The extensibility of MLIR has allowed us to target less established, yet very promising, vector architectures, such as those offering scalable vectors. In this presentation, we will give an overview of the key building blocks of scalable vectorisation and provide a status update on the implementation. Specifically, we will talk about the ongoing effort to support SVE and SME as real-world end-to-end examples that leverage Linalg vectorization and target-specific dialects in MLIR.",

To make high-performance VMs easier to engineer, we present Deegen, a compiler-compiler that uses LLVM to statically generate a JIT-capable VM from C++ execution semantics of the bytecodes. Currently, Deegen is capable of automatically generating a two-tier VM execution engine (consisting of an optimized interpreter, a baseline JIT and the tier-switching logic). We are in the progress of generating the third-tier optimizing JIT. To demonstrate Deegen's capability in the real world, we implemented LuaJIT Remake (LJR), a standard-compliant VM for Lua 5.1. Across a variety of benchmarks, we demonstrated that LJR's interpreter significantly outperforms LuaJIT's interpreter, and LJR's baseline JIT generates high-quality code with a negligible compilation cost.",

This optimization addresses cases where there are multiple arrays of the structure that we want to optimize. The second optimization, Nested Container Flattening (NCF) relocates some of the data members of one C++ class (e.g. class D) to another class (e.g. class A). As we will explain in the talk, this allows us to reduce the number of load instructions and improve locality of data accessed in the program. These optimizations have significant impact on some of the SPEC CPU bemchmarks.

One such technique is outlining of repeated instruction sequences. The idea of differential outlining is to look for similar instruction sequences rather than same sequences of instructions to outline. If there are two sequences of instructions that are similar, then the sequences can be outlined with one of the sequences. The original sequences can then be replaced with a jump to the outline. For one with unwanted changes in the outline due to the differences, the effects from the differences are reverted after the jump back.",

We then highlight interesting out-of-tree applications that suggest limitations in the model.

We compare the accuracy and performance of existing implementations of standard math library functions across GPU targets. The analysis highlights when target-agnostic implementations from LIBM produce accurate results on GPU targets. The existing LLVM intrinsics or LIBM target-agnostic implementations are, in many cases, comparable to vendor libraries in precision and performance. However, the analysis also highlights weak spots where LIBM needs to rely on vendor implementations for now. We propose a fully functional GPU math library that, as a starting point, mixes vendor and LLVM native implementations. It will provide the users with the best possible performance and precision and, if mutually exclusive, offer configurations prioritizing the former or the latter.",

      "abstract": "The TableGen infrastructure holds a pivotal position within LLVM and its sub-projects, particularly in LLVM backends, where a considerable amount of target-specific information, such as instruction definitions and CPU features, is expressed using TableGen. Furthermore, MLIR also heavily depends on TableGen as its backbone, playing a critical role in defining dialects, custom operators, and lowering rules. Both subsystems contain a significant volume of TableGen code, with over 300 and 44 KLOC utilized in LLVM and MLIR, respectively. Despite its extensive usage, the TableGen language currently lacks a proper code formatter, creating a need for one. To address this issue, we propose a solution that involves adding support for TableGen in Clang-Format. By building on top of the existing Clang-Format codebase, we efficiently achieve this with minimal modifications, benefiting from code reuse and ensuring seamless compatibility with its core functionalities. These modifications enable the Clang-Format to recognize a majority of the TableGen syntax including conditional statements, loops, and keywords such as def and multiclass. This effort contributes to enhancing code consistency and readability within TableGen, further empowering developers working on LLVM and its related projects.",

      "abstract": "In this talk, we will introduce extensions to LLVM OpenMP, transforming it into a versatile and performance portable kernel language for GPU programming. We will demonstrate how these extensions allow for the seamless porting of CUDA programs to high-performance OpenMP GPU programs with minimal modifications. Finally, we will present performance results on both NVIDIA and AMD GPUs.",

      "abstract": "This talk offers a quick overview of the current implementation of OpenMP tasking. The objective of this talk is to explain the current state of the implementation and provide guidelines for other developers on how to get started and improve LLVM's OpenMP task support. We first describe the overall compilation pipeline of programs that include OpenMP tasks. We emphasize source code location and the role of each part of the compilation process. Following, we provide a deeper overview of the clang front-end. Next, we provide an overview of the runtime system interface and implementation. Finally, we provide hints on how to test new functionalities and debug the runtime.",

      "abstract": "PGO can have the biggest impact when all compiler passes have accurate profile information, but in practice many parts of the compilation pipeline introduce inaccuracies. Recent PGO evaluations have measured accuracy of imported profiles, ignoring distortion from later optimizations, or looked at aggregate performance, which is often too noisy to correlate with profile accuracy. We propose new metrics that compare end-of-compilation profile data against instruction traces, letting us check the accuracy of profile data end-to-end and decoupling it from performance measurement noise. We share our experience using these new metrics to measure the accuracy of profiles used in PGO, pinpoint areas for improvement, and evaluate new fixes.",
